```js
const addup = num => {
    return num * (num + 1) / 2;
};
```

## Strategy

.The function aims to compute the sum of all integers from 1 to a given number num.
. The function takes a single parameter num, applies a formula (num * (num + 1) / 2) to calculate the sum, and returns the result.

## Implementation

. addcode This implementation defines the addup function using an arrow function with implicit return. It takes a single parameter num and returns the sum calculated using the formula (num * (num + 1)) / 2.
. The arrow function syntax provides a concise and readable way to define the function with minimal boilerplate code.
. This implementation is both simple and correct, efficiently achieving the desired functionality of summing integers from 1 to num. It's concise and utilizes JavaScript's arrow function syntax for brevity.


## Possible Refactors
1.Add error handling to ensure num is a non-negative integer.
2.Improve readability by providing more descriptive variable names or adding comments explaining the formula.
3.Consider converting the function to accept an array of numbers and summing them up, offering more flexibility.


## References
No external references are necessary as the implementation relies on a simple mathematical formula. However, if using similar code in a larger project, referencing mathematical concepts or JavaScript documentation for arrow functions may be helpful.
